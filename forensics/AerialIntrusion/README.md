Aerial Intrusion

## Description: 
SkyPwn Airlines offers in-flight WiFi and an onboard video streaming service for passengers. Recently, during a routine flight, all passenger screens briefly froze and the network experienced a sudden, unexplained outage. While service quickly resumed, this disruption was highly unusual.

Our internal team suspects this was not just a technical glitch. It may have been a targeted attempt to compromise the aircraft’s digital services. A packet capture from the flight’s network was retrieved just moments before and during the anomaly.

Your task is to analyze the captured traffic and uncover what occurred during the incident. The evidence may still be in transit.

## Brief: 
The challenge is about an encrypted MP4 file that was stolen by an attacker through the airplane's network. They have to use tshark to extract the segments of the mp4 file and the keys from the pcap file they were given.
