# Internal Investigation

## Description:
We acquired this disk image without Khalid (our intern) knowing because we are conducting an internal investigation at Meta Airlines. We suspect someone has connections with a shady organization that steals aviation technologies, especially flight simulator software, cockpit interface designs, and advanced navigation systems. Can you figure out if he is involved with them or not?
