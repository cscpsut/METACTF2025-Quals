# Brute-Forcing Character Pairs
The hash is processed in chunks, and for every two-character segment of the flag, we iterate over all combinations of printable ASCII characters. This step is necessary due to the lack of direct mapping between characters and their hashed representation.

# Solving for Parameters
Each candidate character pair is substituted into a known equation derived from the challenge. We solve the equation to determine the corresponding parameters a and b.

# Validation
If the computed values of a and b are both prime integers, then the character pair is considered valid and likely part of the original flag.
