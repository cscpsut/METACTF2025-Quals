# Buggy

## Description: 
Once upon a midnight dreary, as we flew, quick and cheery
Over many a quaint and curious volume of lonely clouds
While I nodded, yearly yapping, suddenly there came a trapping,
As of some one gently bugging, debugging at my chamber door.
"'Tis some vector," I muttered, "'ceptions at my chamber doorâ€”
Only this and nothing more."
