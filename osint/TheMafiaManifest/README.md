# The Mafia Manifest

## Description: 
Mario Mazzanti, known online as mmazzanti_jetlife, flaunts luxury jets, designer suits, and a lifestyle too lavish for a self-proclaimed “travel influencer.” But in September 2024, Mario took a discreet flight — not for pleasure, but for business… mafia business.

Intel suggests he visited a notorious crime syndicate to finalize an illicit deal. His digital trail is full of carefully curated distractions, but subtle breadcrumbs remain. Investigators believe a fake identity was used, but someone slipped.

There might be another account of his lurking around

Your mission is:

Identify the airline or private operator that flew Mario in September 2024.

Discover the mafia organization he’s affiliated with.

Uncover Mario's passport number he used for the trip.
